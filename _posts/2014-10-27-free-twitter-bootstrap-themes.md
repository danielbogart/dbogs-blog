Today I got to the point with my current contract project that I couldn't stand looking at the vanilla Bootstrap theme any longer. I had modified navbar and well colors per client request (teal and bright yellow in case you were wondering), and was feeling embarassed looking at what the site had become in terms of aesthetics. Since I didn't want to buy a theme that the client may not end up ultimately using, I decided to see what I could whip up just using free Bootstrap themes. There are plenty of paid options, and the free themes are fewer and generally less robust. 

Here are a few sites I scoured for the free stuff:

* [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/) - professional looking full themes that rival paid options
* [Bootstrap Zero](http://bootstrapzero.com/) - aggregates free themes from a few other sites like Bootswatch
* [Bootswatch](http://bootswatch.com/) - clean, simple, free themes
* [Love Bootstrap](http://www.lovebootstrap.com/bootstrap-themes/free) - biggest selection and many user submitted themes (my favorite)

I ended up using [Moderna](http://bootstraptaste.com/free-bootstrap-template-corporate-moderna/) from Love Bootsrap and the site is looking substantially more presentable. The site feels clean, professional, and even with the teal navbar (sorry yellow wells, you gotta go), very usable. In the future I'd like to agree on a Bootstrap (or Zurb, or whichever framework is used) theme before beginning the project, and won't hesitate to go with a paid theme if requested.
