A few quick thoughts on my experience launching my second Jekyll blog ([the Moving Bro blog](http://blog.movingbro.com) is well worth a look).

Jekyll is quick and easy to set up, and for a novice programmer, helps gain familiarity with markdown. Less hand holding than Wordpress, and it feels like easier customization and quicker posting once you've nailed the rake commands and formatting. You can simply host the blog on github pages, or use a hosting provider like I did. It took me just a few minutes to add a blog. subdomain on hostgator and use FileZilla to throw the blog online via FTP.

What's lacking is the massive community that Wordpress has, which provides myriad themes and plugins. For my purposes, I'll stick to Jekyll. However, if I was building a blog and hoped to have non-technical contributors, I'd go Wordpress all the way.
