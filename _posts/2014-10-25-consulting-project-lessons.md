A month ago I was fortunate enough to pick up a contract project from a fellow Rubyist who didn't have enough time to finish the job for his client. This particular project is for a university researcher, and entailed digitizing a lengthy set of forms that specific types of treatment clinics frequently must file. The project require a usable and elegant website with authentication, several layers of administration, a coherent workflow to fill out the many forms, and formatted CSV data exports.

This project has been a major learning experience for me, and not just in the technical realm. One of the first things I realized on beginning the project is how difficult it is to pick up a project and unwind the thread. My first order of business was to understand exactly what had already been built (it was already maybe 50% complete), and try to acertain the logic behind it. It felt like showing up to the construction site for the Freedom Tower with it halfway built, and have the contractor hand me a hammer, tell me to get started, and then walk away.

Now I did have some occasional guidance, but my correspondence with the project owner was few and far between. <b>Lesson:</b> spend a substantial amount of time with whoever created the code base to understand their code, their logic, and their vision. Ask questions frequently. Don't be timid to suggest an alternative method if it may be more effective in the long run.

Now that the project is nearing it's end, the project owner is meeting with our client to get feedback and adjust minor details. Our client frequently has vague design requests such as "change the navbar to a blue like on the Nike site". I don't at all mind design work, and appreciate a beautifully crafted site, but these types of request I find obtuse and difficult to translate into an attractive website. Since there was never a coherent design scheme or theme agreed on, the site used Twitter Bootstrap's design elements and basic color scheme.

<b>Lesson:</b> create a clear vision for the website design with several sites that the client already likes the look of and can be used as a template. Request that they be extremely specific. Be hard and fast about how many iterations you will give them on design work. It feels like this project could easily drag on two or three weeks beyond what I'd like just because this expectation has not been set.

Overall the project is an invaluble experience, and a great addition to my contracting portfolio. When I begin future projects, I now know to create clear and specific goals and expectations, and ensure that my vision is in synch with my client's.
